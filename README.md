# Easyfood
## Description

This project is a web application built with the Symfony framework, developed as part of a team using the SCRUM agile methodology. It allows restaurant owners and customers to manage food deliveries. However, please note that the application is still a work in progress and is not fully functional.

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Installation with WAMP

1. Download and install WAMP from [here](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).
2. Once WAMP is installed, start the WAMP server (make sure Apache and MySQL are running).
3. Open WAMP's PHPMyAdmin and create a new database (e.g., `easyfood`).
4. Follow the steps below to clone and set up the project.
