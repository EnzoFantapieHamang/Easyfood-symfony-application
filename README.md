# Easyfood

Easyfood is a collaborative project developed as part of a team effort to build a Symfony application from scratch. This project allowed us to deepen our understanding of UML, as we began with a detailed design phase before moving on to coding. By following the Scrum methodology, we managed the project with clarity and efficiency. Finally, we successfully deployed the application.
